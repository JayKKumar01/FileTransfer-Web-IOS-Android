## Overview

This web application enables **peer-to-peer file transfer** using PeerJS and works seamlessly on **both iOS and Android devices**.

Its **main highlight** is the combination of **QR code-based peer connection** and **seamless cross-platform file transfer**, which allows users to send files **super easily, without any quality loss**, and **without relying on cloud storage**. The workflow is designed to be **smooth, fast, and intuitive**, making file sharing between iOS and Android devices effortless.

Key capabilities include:

* **Instant QR code-based peer connection** for super-fast setup without typing IDs.
* **Cross-platform file transfer** between iOS and Android with original file quality preserved.
* **Send and receive multiple files simultaneously**, including large files.
* **Dynamic file chunking** to optimize transfer speed.
* **Optional ZIP compression** for received files (up to 4‚ÄØGB on iOS).
* **Platform-specific optimizations** for iOS (prevent pinch/zoom, viewport adjustments, Wake Lock API).
* **Real-time transfer progress and speed monitoring**.
